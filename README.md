## Overview

We will be able to write an application that leverages multiple Watson AI services like Discovery, Assistant, Cloud Function and Node Red. By the end of the project we will learn best practices of combining Watson Services, and how they can build interactive retrieval system with discovery + assistant.

## Purpose

The chatbot usually can answer just simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions and maybe even making appointments. When any user input (question) falls out of the scope of the predetermined question set of chatbot, it typically tells us to rephrase our sentence or mention that this question is not valid.
In this project we will be emphasizing to reduce the workload from the representative by supervising our chatbot in such a way that it is able to answer much of the questions (in particular the product information). We can return the relevant sections from the user guide which can help us to reduce the number of clients of every representative at a call centre. We will be transferring the call to representatives in particular cases only. To take this a step further, the project shall use the Smart Document Understanding provided by the Watson Discovery to train on the text, which is a modified version of Natural Language Processing.



Scope of Work:

•  Create a customer care dialog skill in Watson Assistant.
•  Use smart document understanding to build an enhanced Watson Discovery Collection. 
•	Create an IBM Cloud Function web action that allows Watson Assistant to post queries to Watson Discovery.
•	Build a web application with integration of all the services and deploy the same on IBM Cloud Platform.
